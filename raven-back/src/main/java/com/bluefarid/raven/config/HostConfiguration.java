 * Configuration class for host properties.

 * The properties are loaded from the application configuration file using the @ConfigurationProperties annotation.
 * The prefix "acpc.host" is used to specify the section of the configuration file from which the properties will be loaded.
 *
 * The @Data annotation is used to generate getter and setter methods for the properties.
 * The @Component annotation marks this class as a Spring component, allowing it to be automatically detected and instantiated
 * by the Spring container.
